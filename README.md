This is a simple mobile app that I put together that allows the user to insert a list of items that may come up on their mind. They can organize by alphabet or by the ID that a item has been given. 
This was writen in Javascript. I am not that great at it but this was something I was able to put together.

This is a video demonstration of the app in action.
